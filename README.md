# Spring 2019 Bio Design

I'll be honest - I am completely new to all things Bio Design. But regardless, I'm fascinated. My interests in this early phase of the semester are geared towards research and explorations within the realm of materials. As an art student, I am intrigued with the notion of producing hands-on work which innovates sustainably and self-sufficiently. My ultimate objective in this regard is to discover uses for materials in both creation and daily life which lessen the burden of humanity on our world and do so elegantly. I am particularly excited to delve into the use of biological materials - to create work which is alive from life itself.



# Projects of Interest

- Natural History of the Enigma (Eduardo Kac, 2003-2008)

The central work in the Natural History of the Enigma is a ‘plantimal’, a new life form created by Eduardo Kac that he calls Edunia, a    genetically engineered flower that is a hybrid of the artist and Petunia. The Edunia expresses Kac’s DNA (specifically, the isolated gene responsible for the identification of foreign entities culled from his blood) exclusively in its red veins. The new flower was invented by and produced by the artist through molecular biology. It is not found in nature.



- Grabbing at Newer Vegetables (Anicka Yi, 2015)

Pioneering what she terms a “biopolitics of the senses,” Yi’s emphasis on olfaction aims to decentralize and hack our perceptual bias toward vision and make us aware of our most primordial and reflexive sense—scent. Part of the brain’s ancient limbic system, our olfactory receptors are deeply embedded with neurological systems that process our memories, moods, and behaviors. Scent and its profound relationship to identity and subjectivity forms the basis of this work which incorporated bacterial samples from 100 women that were then, with the help of M.I.T. synthetic biologist Tal Danino, synthesized into a single strand of bacteria. Yi used this literal culture of women as paint, applied onto an agar canvas. The odor permeating from this installation was quite powerful, literally and in concept, as the installation has served a deeply feminist affront to cultural biases held toward bodily odors.



- Victimless Leather (Tissue Culture and Art Project, 2004)

This ‘victimless leather’ is grown inside a custom made perfusion chamber (an automatic dripping system which drips into the polymers and feeds the cells) from immortalised cell lines which are cultured and form a living layer of tissue supported by a biodegradable polymer matrix in the form of a miniature stitch-less coat-like shape. Growing the material problematizes the concept of garment by making it semi-living. As such, the project is intended to confront people with the moral implications of wearing parts of dead animals for protective and aesthetic reasons and confronts notions of relationships with manipulated living systems.
