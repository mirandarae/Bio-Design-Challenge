# Spring 2019 Bio Design
I'll be honest - I am completely new to all things Bio Design. 
But regardless, I'm fascinated. 
My interests in this early phase of the semester are geared towards research and explorations within the realm of materials. 
As an art student, I am intrigued with the notion of producing hands-on work which innovates sustainably and self-sufficiently. 
My ultimate objective in this regard is to discover uses for materials in both creation and daily life which lessen the burden of humanity on our world and do so elegantly. 
I am particularly excited to delve into the use of biological materials - to create work which is alive from life itself.
